🎯 Python Mini Projects Collection

Welcome to my Python Mini Projects repository!
This collection showcases several beginner-to-intermediate level Python projects that demonstrate my understanding of logic building, modular programming, and hands-on problem solving.

🚀 Projects Included
🎲 1. Rolling a Die

Simulates rolling a 6-faced die using random numbers.

Each roll generates a random number between 1 and 6.

Demonstrates use of the random module and loops.
🧠 Concepts used: Random module, loops, conditionals

🔢 2. Number Guess Game

The program randomly selects a number, and the user must guess it.

Gives feedback like “Too High” or “Too Low” until the correct number is guessed.
🧠 Concepts used: Random module, loops, user input handling

⚙️ 3. Modularization Example

Demonstrates code reusability by splitting logic into functions and modules.

Shows how to import and reuse code efficiently.
🧠 Concepts used: Functions, modular programming, imports

✊ 4. Rock–Paper–Scissors Game

A fun interactive game between user and computer.

Follows standard rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.
🧠 Concepts used: Conditional statements, randomization, loops

🔳 5. QR Code Generator

Generates a QR code from user-input text or links.

Saves the QR code as an image file.
🧠 Concepts used: qrcode library, file handling, user input

🧩 Skills & Concepts Covered
  Python Basics (variables, data types, loops, conditionals)
  Random number generation
  Functions and modular programming
  File handling
  Working with external libraries
  Problem-solving and game logic design

🛠️ Technologies Used
  Language: Python
  Libraries: random, qrcode, sys, os
  Tools: Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub
